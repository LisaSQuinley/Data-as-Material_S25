<p class="para1">
    <span id="chapter">13</span> If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have <span class="love">love</span>, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. <span class="line">2</span> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have <span class="love">love</span>, I am nothing. <span class="line">3</span> If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have <span class="love">love</span>, I gain nothing.
</p>
<p class="para2">
    <span class="line">4</span> <span class="love">Love</span> is patient, <span class="love">love</span> is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. <span class="line">5</span> It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. <span class="line">6</span> <span class="love">Love</span> does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. <span class="line">7</span> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
</p>
<p class="para3">    
    <span class="line">8</span> <span class="love">Love</span> never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. <span class="line">9</span> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <span class="line">10</span> but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. <span class="line">11</span> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. <span class="line">12</span> For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
</p>
<p class="para4">    
    <span class="line">13</span> And now these three remain: faith, hope and <span class="love">love</span>. But the greatest of these is <span class="love">love</span>.
